# The Exit Equation: Employee Attrition (Excel + Predictive Dashboard)
 > Self-initiated project to practice HR analytics, Excel dashboarding, and predictive modeling skills.

## TL;DR
**Problem**: **16% of employees were leaving,** but risk drivers weren't clearly quantified across departments and tenure groups.

**Process**: Analyzed **1,470 employee records using Excel dashboards** and **logistic regression** to segment attrition risk by tenure, overtime, income, satisfaction, and role.

**Result**: **Fresh hires (0-1 year)** show **34.88%** attrition, and overtime employees are 3x more likely to leave, highlighting early-stage burnout and workload imbalance as primary risk factors.

## Dashboard & Predictive Highlights
## Excel Dashboard
* **Churn by department**
* **High-risk job roles**
* **Employee satisfaction patterns**
  
![Dashboard Preview](dashboard_preview.png)

Interactive charts enable HR to **instantly identify trends and high-risk groups,** while predictive modeling highlights the employees most likely to leave, turning insights into actionable steps.

## Predictive Analysis (Logistic Regression)
The model enables HR to prioritize intervention for high-risk employees before resignation occurs.

* **Key Insights from the Model:**
   - Over time increases the likelihood of leaving
   - Higher Job Satisfaction decreases attrition
   - Single employees and certain job roles are more likely to leave
  - Feature importance charts & probability plots highlight actionable drivers
> The model achieved interpretable feature importance outputs, allowing HR stakeholders to understand not just who is at risk, but why.

## Overview
This analysis leverages a **synthetic HR dataset of 1,470 employees** to uncover the **key drivers of attrition** across departments, roles, and demographics. Using **Excel-based modeling,** it turns raw HR data into **actionable insights** that help HR teams **spot trends, reduce turnover, and make smarter strategic decisions.**

## Key Questions Answered 
 * Which departments and roles experience the **highest attrition**?
 * Are there **demographic or workload patterns** linked to exits?
 * How do **satisfaction, income, and tenure** influence turnover?
 * What factors increase or decrease the likelihood of leaving (predictive)?
 * Which employee cohorts are at **greatest risk of leaving**?

## KPIs Tracked
 * **Total Attrition Rate**: 16.12%
 * **Fresh Hire Attrition (0-1 year)**: 34.88%
 * **Highest Attrition Department**: Sales (20.63%)
 * **Highest Attrition Role**: Sales Representative (39.76%) 

## Business Insights & Strategic Recommendations
> These findings shift attrition from a historical metric to a forward-looking risk management tool.

## Departmental Trends
- **Sales:** 20.63% attrition
- **Human Resources:** 19.05% attrition

**Recommendation:** Reassess quota pressure, performance incentives, and support structure in high-attrition departments like **Sales** to reduce burnout-driven exits.

## Role-Specific Breakdown
- **Sales Representatives:** 39.76% attrition (≈4x company average)
- **Research Directors:** 2.5% attrition

**Recommendation:** Introduce structured onboarding support and incentive recalibration for quota-driven roles to stabilize early attrition.

## Gender-Based Patterns
Male attrition: **17.01%** | Female attrition: **14.80%**

**Recommendation:** Conduct role-level and promotion-cycle audits to determine whether advancement velocity or workload distribution differs by gender.

## Overtime & Burnout
- **Overtime employees:** **30.53%** attrition vs **10.44%** for others

 **Recommendation:** Reallocate workload or redesign incentive structures in overtime-heavy teams to reduce burnout-driven exits.

## Compensation & Retention 
- **Lower-income employees:** **28.61%** attrition

**Recommendation:** Reassess compensation bands for lower-income cohorts to mitigate income-driven attrition risk.

## Tenure & Retention 
- **Fresh hires (0-1 yrs):** **34.88%** attrition vs **12.91%** for 5+ year employees.

**Recommendation:** Introduce structured 30-60-90 day onboarding check-ins and early engagement interventions to reduce first-year attrition.

## Satisfaction Metrics
- **Work-Life Balance:** 31.25% attrition
- **Job Satisfaction:** 22.84% attrition

**Recommendation:** Integrate quarterly pulse surveys with attrition probability scores to proactively intervene in high-risk employee segments.

## Tools Used
* **Microsoft Excel** - Data cleaning, pivot tables, KPI tracking, and dashboard design.
* **Python (Pandas + scikit-learn + matplotlib):** Predictive modeling, feature importance, probability plots

## What I'd Explore Next
As a next step to deepen this analysis:
 * Add **exit interview data** to capture *qualitative* reasons for leaving
 * Explore **time-based patterns** in attrition (e.g., seasonality, post-promotion exits)
 * Integrate **employee engagement survey results** to enrich predictive signals.

## What This Project Demonstrates
 - Ability to translate HR data into actionable business insights
 - Experience combining descriptive dashboards with predictive analytics
 - Understanding attrition metrics and predictive modeling workflow
 - Exposure to full analysis cycle: data cleaning → visualization → predictive modeling → insights
